# Dog Breed Classifier - Udacity Project

This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model (ResNet18) to classify dog breeds from images.

## How to use
1. Upload your dog images to the repository (or a folder named `sample_images`).
2. Run `check_images_v2.py` to see the predicted dog breeds.
3. The model is pre-trained using PyTorch's ResNet18.
